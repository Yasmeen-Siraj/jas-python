This is my first time trying to scrape a web page, but it was fun. My only problem was in the specified timeline .. so I couldn't complete the following tasks :
  1 - Only part of the table data was extracted due to  page scrolling feature.
  2 - I havent used Stackblits befire, so I needed more time to get used to it
